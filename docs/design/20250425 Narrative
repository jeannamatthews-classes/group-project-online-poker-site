This week has been a little easier. Our team is all back from their respective trips and able to get back on track as the deadline approached. We met on Thursday to divy up the remaining work.
Calvin would continue to work on connecting the backend to the frontend, Cody would update the Game state UI where he would add features that Calvin had asked for to make sure the game works
properly. Sam and Jason would make some slight changes to their already completed parts (Jason would readd his hand ranks to his logic that got deleted and Sam improve the styling of the CSS files
for the Home page). Sam and Jason also became available to help Calvin and Cody finish the parts they were working on before Tuesday. As of now it seems like Calvin and Cody have a good grasp on
finishing their tasks, but as the deadline nears our team is prepared to help eachother where necessary. Also Sam has begun work on creating a new presentation for Tuesday.
