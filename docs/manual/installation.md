# **📌 Setup Instructions 📌**

Make sure you have some sort of IDE or software installed to be able to run Javascript

*For any other concerns that are not addressed in here consult the Readme.md file!*

## Setup 💻 

1. Install Node.js on your system (https://nodejs.org/en/download)
   
2. Install react router dom ( run npm install react-router-dom on your system)
   
3. Install the cors package (npm install cors)

## Running The Game 🎰 🃏 💰
1. Open two terminal windows
2. CD both terminal windows into the Poker-UI directory (or whatever the React Project is titled on your system)
   
3. To start the client (browser app): REACT_APP_SERVER_IP=[server ip] npm start
   
4. Which server ip should you use when starting the client? If you want to test on the local machine, put localhost. If you want to connect to the production server, put 128.153.145.204.
   
5. On a different terminal window start the server by running node src/server/index.js
   
6. Once you run npm start you will have a tab opened on your computer (it will be titled something like localhost:3000)
   
7. On this tab enter any username, and a game ID (some string of numbers). Make sure you remember this game ID
    
8. Open another tab (copy and past the localhost:3000 link into a new tab) and enter a new username with a different game ID.
    
9. Once you are done playing go back to your terminal window and hit Control C on both terminal windows to end the process.
