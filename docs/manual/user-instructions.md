### 🎰 How to Play 🎰

At the start of the game the person directly to the left of the dealer is labeled the small blind. This person is forced to bet half of the minimum bet at the start of each game. After the small
blind is the big blind, where they are forced to bet the minimum bet. After the blinds are placed out, the first betting round commences. 

Each player is either forced to match the bet made by the big blind, fold or raise the bet (each player can only raise once per round of betting). Once everyone has either matched the bet 
or folded you move on to the next round. 

The next 3 rounds start with cards being placed on the community board. For the second turn 3 cards are revealed, and for the third and fourth turn 1 card is revealed. 
Each of these rounds requires more bets to be made. Players can either check, see the next card without paying anymore, fold, raise the pot to a higher price or call a previous players bet. 
This process is the same for the second third and fourth round of bets. Once all bets are made the remaining players show there card and the best hand remaining wins the pot.

A hand is considered the best group of 5 cards that you can make combining your personal cards with the five cards from the community board. The ranks of different hands is described below.
