Week of 10 March
This is a short list of what I've acomplished so far- 

Worked on the GANTT chart witht the team
Did a little bit of research with CSS and HTML since that's what we'll be using. But I haven't gotten too far with that
Updated the design doc with my part about how users will host or join games.

Week of 24 March
Thursday: 
- Met with group (1 hour)
- Stayed behind to research javascript (1 hour)

Friday:
- Just some more Java Script Research, won't get to work on this during the weekend

Busy week, had some tests earlier on and a bunch of other work. Didn't get to as much as I'd like but this upcomming week looks good for progress.

Week of 1 April:

This week for me is busy with not only other classwork but some ROTC commitments, especially for this weekend and prep for that. Also coming up next thursday I'll be gone again
I was able to squeeze some things in but it isn't enough to push anything to the github directory just yet. 
I was able to learn more Java Script for ~3 hours.
Since Mcgee has started the backend for poker logic, but hasn't completly finished it yet, I will probably hop in and try to expand on that for this upcomming week.
