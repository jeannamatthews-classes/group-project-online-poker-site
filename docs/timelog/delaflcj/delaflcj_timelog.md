Week of 10 March
This is a short list of what I've acomplished so far- 

Worked on the GANTT chart witht the team
Did a little bit of research with CSS and HTML since that's what we'll be using. But I haven't gotten too far with that
Updated the design doc with my part about how users will host or join games.

Week of 24 March
Thursday: 
- Met with group (1 hour)
- Stayed behind to research javascript (1 hour)

Friday:
- Just some more Java Script Research, won't get to work on this during the weekend

Busy week, had some tests earlier on and a bunch of other work. Didn't get to as much as I'd like but this upcomming week looks good for progress.

Week of 1 April:

This week for me is busy with not only other classwork but some ROTC commitments, especially for this weekend and prep for that. Also coming up next thursday I'll be gone again
I was able to squeeze some things in but it isn't enough to push anything to the github directory just yet. 
I was able to learn more Java Script for ~3 hours.
Since Mcgee has started the backend for poker logic, but hasn't completly finished it yet, I will probably hop in and try to expand on that for this upcomming week.

Week of 13 April:
Saturday: ~3 horus
My job now is to connect the ui to some of the logic we're now using. I am creating a way to display the pot properly and to display player information, like cards, bet, chips etc.
I spent approx 3 hours trying to get some different things to work but I didn't get much coding progress done since the things I was trying weren't working but I have a good spot to start tomorrow, on Sunday.

Sunday: ~2 hours
I picked back up after talking with the team for a couple minutes. I didn't get the all of the variables inputted yet since Calvin wanted to set those up I think so he'll just replace the variable names with what he's got. I have to do a little bit more work to get it so when another player joins they're information will display in a new empty seat

Week of 20 April:

Working on UI most of this Week
Friday ~4 Hours: Updating UI so the pot variables on the table render correctly and the player values actually display

Week of 27 April
Wednesday ~3 Hours: Got the player cards displaying nicely, so they have cards, chips, a background, and are static. The seat positioning will come tomorrow but the player displays look good now.
Thursday ~3 Hours: Worked a bit on the UI, found some errors/bugs that needed to be fixed which is weird because they weren't there yesterday and I didn't update the project or pull anything from our github... I don't know how that works. I ended up updating some of the server index stuff, I also accidently deleted some of Calvin's comments (Sorry Calvin) but the server works again and there were some weird bugs having to do with the buttons not working and the cards never displaying. past that I got the seat positioning down. There may still be a bug with more than 4 players joining but I will have to look into that on another day.
