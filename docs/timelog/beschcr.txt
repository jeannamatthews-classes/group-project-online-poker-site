BEFORE BREAK:
I don't remember when I did all of this, but here's the work I remember doing recently.

Researching what technologies we would need - 2 hours
Learning HTML and CSS - 3 hours
Learning JS/Node - 3 hours
Coding really small sample project just to make sure I understand
how the project needs to be structured - 2 hours
Gantt Chart - 1 hour
Determining project structure - 2 hours


We agreed not to work on the project over spring break.


3/25:
Group Meeting (1 hr)
HTML/CSS practice webpage (.5 hr)

3/27:
More JS tutorials (2 hr)

3/28:
Learning how WebSockets work/how to do basic website request handling (1.5 hr)
Working on sample site because I'm supposed to wait for my groupmates to post thier things so I can work on mine (2.5 hr)

4/6:
Learning React.js (1 hr)
Trying to understand the code teammates uploaded (1 hr)

(I didn't do much this week because I was still supposed to wait for the team to do the poker logic and UI.
My role was decided to be to get these two things to work together and with actual internet connections, and
that stuff was just submitted today (4/6.) I learned and practiced the stuff I knew I would need and then didn't
know what else to do, so I'll just work more on it this week. Although they did not end up using the project 
structure in the design doc so I think my role will be a little more undefined and chaotic than I had expected.)
