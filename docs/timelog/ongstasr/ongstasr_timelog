March 14th 2025 Timelog:

 - First I researched different tech stacks that I believed would help create our project. I found that React.JS and Node.JS would be the nmost helpful libraries (with Javascript being the best
language). We discussed as a team that IDE did not matter and we could use whatever we were most comfortable with.
 - Then I began to sketch my UI ideas. I sketched a UI for the home screen and the game screen and wrote detailed descriptions about the functionalities of each of these screens
and their features.
 - Finally I fooled around with React.JS to get more comfortable with it as I begin to build the User Interface.



March 30th 2025 Timelog: 

Monday:
- I continued to watch React tutorials to familiar myself with CSS and Javascript so that I had a better foundation to begin building our webpag with (1 hour 30 minutes)

Tuesday:
- I began work on the home page of the UI. I created the home page and added a background image, a text box and a join button to get to the game page (2 hours)

Text box is used to enter the username of the player (required to join the game)
Join button at this time did not do anything but eventually made it take player to the game page if they provided a username

Wednesday:
- No Work

Thursday: 
- Met with group (1 hour)
- Mde stylistic changes to home page (30 minutes)

Changed background image, font colors, location of text and components and resizing

Friday/Saturday:
- Began work on the Game page for the UI. Added a start game button, and spent a good amount of time learning how to format and organize different elements of a webpage (2 hours)

Right now there is only a start game button that does nothing, but soon will update to have button start a game of poker and have more options appear when pressed
Also have text sharing the username to make sure that it is being properly stored when they join the game

Sunday:
No work

I have yet to committ and code to Github, so to prove I did work I attatched screenshots of the work I completed.



April 6th 2025 Timelog:

Monday: Cleaned up the organization of JS components. Some of the containers were not in the correct places of the hierarchies. Also made minor stylistic changes (1 hour).

Tuesday - Wednesday: No work, studying for exams

Thursday: Met with Jason, and discussed the new way github materials were being organized. Also just caught each other up on the progress we were making. Then for the
remaining duration of the meeting I worked on updating my CSS files to make the UI look slightly better (1 hour 30 minutes).

Friday: No work two exams

Saturday: Started by creating a a gamestate to handle whether or not a game of poker had yet to be started. This created three new buttons. I only implemeneted 1 of the buttons that being
the Raise button, where I learned how to create an input box that only accepted integers and required input to submit a bet. I also learned how to change colors of a button whether or not
certain criteria were met, and made the text box dissapear once the user submitted there bet amount (3 hours).

Sunday: Documented my code, and created some endpoints for different game points to make it easier for those who are implementing the back end to edit my already made UI. I also spent a while 
learning how to upload my repository to GIT, and connecting my VSCode to this repository (1 hour 30 minutes).

April 13th 2025 Timelog:

Monday: Updated some documentation for the codes before Calvin got to work. Made sure it was as easy as possible for him to start work on his part (1 hour).

Tuesday-Wednesday: Communicated with Calvin and other group mates to figure out who was available for RAPS and started work on the presentation (1 hour).

Thursday: RAPS Prep. I created the slideshow, organized the parts of our project that were done and practiced the presentation. I also broke up the presentation amongst who would be in attendance (2.5 hours).

Friday: RAPS Presentation (2 hours).

Sunday: Updated Plan sheet to more accurately represent what our future plans were and also created our high level narative for the week (1 hour).
