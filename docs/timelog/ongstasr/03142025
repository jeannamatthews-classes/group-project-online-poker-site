Here are the things I did recently

 - First I researched different tech stacks that I believed would help create our project. I found that React.JS and Node.JS would be the nmost helpful libraries (with Javascript being the best
language). We discussed as a team that IDE did not matter and we could use whatever we were most comfortable with.
 - Then I began to sketch my UI ideas. I sketched a UI for the home screen and the game screen and wrote detailed descriptions about the functionalities of each of these screens
and their features.
 - Finally I fooled around with React.JS to get more comfortable with it as I begin to build the User Interface.
