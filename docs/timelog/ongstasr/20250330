Sam Ongstad Timelog 03/30/2025 - 

Monday:
- I continued to watch React tutorials to familiar myself with CSS and Javascript so that I had a better foundation to begin building our webpag with (1 hour 30 minutes)

Tuesday:
- I began work on the home page of the UI. I created the home page and added a background image, a text box and a join button to get to the game page (2 hours)

Text box is used to enter the username of the player (required to join the game)
Join button at this time did not do anything but eventually made it take player to the game page if they provided a username

Wednesday:
- No Work

Thursday: 
- Met with group (1 hour)
- Mde stylistic changes to home page (30 minutes)

Changed background image, font colors, location of text and components and resizing

Friday/Saturday:
- Began work on the Game page for the UI. Added a start game button, and spent a good amount of time learning how to format and organize different elements of a webpage (2 hours)

Right now there is only a start game button that does nothing, but soon will update to have button start a game of poker and have more options appear when pressed
Also have text sharing the username to make sure that it is being properly stored when they join the game

Sunday:
No work

I have yet to committ and code to Github, so to prove I did work I attatched screenshots of the work I completed.
